# FlashCAMP Hierarchical Model Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for integrating the hierarchical model capabilities into the FlashCAMP application. The hierarchical model has been trained on 54,000 real startup samples and provides significantly improved prediction accuracy and explainability compared to previous versions.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Backend Integration

- [x] Train hierarchical model on 54,000 real startup samples
- [x] Implement pillar models (Capital, Advantage, Market, People) using LightGBM
- [x] Implement meta-model using XGBoost
- [x] Generate SHAP visualizations
- [x] Optimize thresholds for different use cases
- [x] Create model metadata JSON file
- [x] Enhance ML engine to support hierarchical model logic
- [x] Implement recommendation generation based on SHAP values
- [x] Update API routes to support hierarchical model endpoints
- [x] Update model paths to use models trained on real data

### 2. Frontend Component Creation

- [x] Define TypeScript interfaces for API responses in `api.ts`
- [x] Create `HierarchicalModelResults.tsx` component for displaying prediction results
- [x] Create `RecommendationsPanel.tsx` component for displaying model-generated recommendations
- [x] Create `PredictionVisualization.tsx` component for displaying model visualization
- [x] Create `ModelInfoPanel.tsx` component for displaying model metadata and performance metrics
- [x] Update `ResultsPage.tsx` to integrate new components with tab-based UI

### 3. Documentation

- [x] Update `TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md` with hierarchical model details
- [x] Document model architecture, performance metrics, and threshold optimizations
- [x] Document API endpoints for the hierarchical model

### 4. Backend Implementation

- [x] Implement real API endpoints for hierarchical model in FastAPI:
  - [x] `POST /api/prediction/predict` endpoint for model predictions
  - [x] `POST /api/prediction/recommendations` endpoint for generating recommendations
  - [x] `POST /api/prediction/visualization` endpoint for SHAP visualizations
  - [x] `GET /api/prediction/model-info` endpoint for model metadata
- [x] Test API endpoints with the test script

### 5. Frontend Integration

- [x] Connect frontend components to real API endpoints (replace mock data)
- [x] Add loading states and error handling for API calls
- [x] Implement feature toggling for hierarchical model (production flag)
- [x] Add user onboarding for hierarchical model features
- [x] Integrate PDF export with hierarchical model results

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Testing and Validation

- [ ] Write unit tests for new React components
- [ ] Create integration tests for end-to-end flows
- [ ] Validate model predictions against known outcomes
- [ ] Test with production-like data volumes

### 2. Deployment and Monitoring

- [ ] Set up monitoring for hierarchical model endpoints
- [ ] Add logging for model predictions and failures
- [ ] Create dashboard for monitoring model performance
- [ ] Implement A/B testing capability to compare models
- [ ] Document rollback procedures

## Timeline

1. **Week 1:** ✅ Complete backend API endpoints
2. **Week 2:** ✅ Connect frontend components to real APIs
3. **Week 3:** Testing, validation, and bug fixes
4. **Week 4:** Documentation, monitoring setup, and final review

## Resources

- Model training code: `flashcamp/pipelines/train_hierarchical.py`
- Model files: `models/v2/`
- API endpoints: `flashcamp/backend/app/routes/prediction.py`
- Frontend components: `flashcamp/frontend/src/components/`

## Success Criteria

1. Hierarchical model achieves 15%+ improvement in prediction accuracy
2. UI successfully displays pillar scores and recommendations
3. End-to-end prediction time under 150ms
4. All unit and integration tests passing
5. Documentation updated and comprehensive
