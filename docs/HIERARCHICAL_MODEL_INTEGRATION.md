# Hierarchical Model Integration

This document describes the integration of the hierarchical model trained on the real dataset with 54,000 samples.

## Overview

We've enhanced the existing ML engine (`flashcamp/backend/app/engines/ml.py`) to use the hierarchical model trained on the real dataset. All previous models have been replaced with the new ones trained on the real dataset.

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced the ML Engine**:
   - Updated model path to use models trained on the real dataset
   - Added support for optimized threshold from model_config.json
   - Enhanced prediction output to include threshold, prediction and confidence
   - Added recommendation generation functionality
   - Added model metadata retrieval functionality

2. **Updated API Routes**:
   - Modified `flashcamp/backend/app/routes/prediction.py` to use the enhanced ML engine

3. **Removed Old Models**:
   - Deleted all old model files trained on synthetic data
   - Replaced with models trained on the real dataset

4. **Created Training Script**:
   - Created `scripts/train_real_dataset.py` to train the hierarchical model on the full dataset
   - Includes threshold optimization

5. **Added Testing Script**:
   - Created `scripts/test_enhanced_ml_engine.py` to verify the integration works correctly

## Training on Real Dataset

The hierarchical model was trained on the full dataset with 54,000 samples:

```bash
python scripts/train_real_dataset.py
```

This script:
1. Loads `seed_dataset_master_final_54000_68.csv` (54,000 samples)
2. Trains four pillar models (Capital, Advantage, Market, People)
3. Trains a meta-model that combines pillar outputs
4. Optimizes the prediction threshold for maximum F1 score
5. Saves models and metadata to `models/v2/`

## API Endpoints

The API endpoints now use the enhanced ML engine:

- **POST /api/prediction/predict**: Predict startup success
- **POST /api/prediction/recommendations**: Get improvement recommendations
- **POST /api/prediction/visualization**: Generate visualization of prediction results
- **GET /api/prediction/model-info**: Get model metadata

## Testing the Integration

To verify the integration works correctly:

```bash
python scripts/test_enhanced_ml_engine.py
```

## Advantages of This Approach

1. **Clean Codebase**: No duplicate code or parallel implementations
2. **Better Performance**: Models trained on 54,000 real samples
3. **Optimized Threshold**: Threshold optimized for the real dataset
4. **Simplified Model Structure**: Single directory for all models
5. **Robust Fallbacks**: Preserves existing fallback mechanisms for missing features

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Integration**: Update the frontend to display the enhanced model outputs
2. **Monitoring**: Add monitoring for model performance metrics
3. **Continuous Training**: Set up scheduled retraining with new data
